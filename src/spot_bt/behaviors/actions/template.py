        Minimal one-time initialisation. A good rule of thumb is
        to only include the initialisation relevant for being able
        to insert this behaviour in a tree for offline rendering to
        dot graphs.

        Other one-time initialisation requirements should be met via
        the setup() method.

        When is this called?
          This function should be either manually called by your program
          to setup this behaviour alone, or more commonly, via method
          `~py_trees.behaviour.Behaviour.setup_with_descendants`
          or method `~py_trees.trees.BehaviourTree.setup`, both of which
          will iterate over this behaviour, it's children (it's children's
          children ...) calling method `~py_trees.behaviour.Behaviour.setup`
          on each in turn.

          If you have vital initialisation necessary to the success
          execution of your behaviour, put a guard in your
          `~py_trees.behaviour.Behaviour.initialise` method
          to protect against entry without having been setup.

        What to do here?
          Delayed one-time initialisation that would otherwise interfere
          with offline rendering of this behaviour in a tree to dot graph
          or validation of the behaviour's configuration.

          Good examples include:

          - Hardware or driver initialisation
          - Middleware initialisation (e.g. ROS pubs/subs/services)
          - A parallel checking for a valid policy configuration after
            children have been added or removed
